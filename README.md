# FILES

- .gitignore
- PA2 R Markdown.Rmd
- PA2-Project.Rproj
- README.md
- Test File.R

As of 16/6/2019, there a a total of 5 files. I'll try to explain what each of these are.

> .gitignore

To be honest, I don't know what this file does but its name is a sequence of .git + ignore. This file was created while installing git I believe and I guess you should ignore it since Git itself is telling you to ignore the file.
